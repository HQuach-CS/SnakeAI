# Snake AI

The goal of this project is to increase my knowledge of some machine learning algorithm. The two algorithm I used to try to achieve 100% completion are genetic algorithm and neural network.

## Skills

With this project, I attended to learn some tools/skills for professional use:

* Machine Learning
* Neural Network
* Genetic Algorithm


## Descripition

The game snake is an old game that is hard to achieve victory in. My goal is to create an AI that can beat the game on any grid size. I decided that this neural network allow the snake to see in 4 or 8 direction or 'Cardinal Direction'. The simplest form is: snake calculate each direction and its length toward an object. Object being itself,wall, or the fruit. The input size is 16x1. 


## Future
* Research more algorithms
* Refactor new population gene factor algorithm 
* Add options for different hyperparameters (Including: Gane options/Machine learning variables)
